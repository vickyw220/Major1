Organization of the Project:

3. Rotate Right (rotate.c`)

Each team member was responsible for writing and testing one of the above operations. In addition:

- Team collaboration included troubleshooting menu flow, input validation, and build issues.

Known Bugs or Problems

- Merging issues: We encountered difficulties combining the independently written functions into a single, functioning major1.c program. These were resolved with extra communication and code reviews.
- Communication gaps: Minor delays and misunderstandings occurred while coordinating which files needed updates at different times.
- No critical bugs remain, but testing was limited to basic cases due to technical issues.
- There was one group member that did not communicate/respond or contribute to the project.(git pus)
